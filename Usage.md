<h1>Getting the Most Out Of Piabetes</h1>
<hr>
<p>Piabetes is very open to how it accepts requests, though it exercises caution when information is suspected of being incorrect. In the event that a request returns with issues, it will simply text "N/A" as the result for the missing items. To keep this from happening, here are a few tips on sending requests.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Keep It Simple</h3>
      <p>To avoid errors, keep your requests short. This means that instead of sending "how many carbs are in 12 grams of french fries?", you should simply send "12 grams french fries". This will help minimize errors that may occur when parsing your request.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Send Brand Names</h3>
      <p>If it is available, send the brand of the food with the request. For example, if the fries are from McDonalds, you should send "mcdonalds french fries", as opposed to just "french fries". However, if you receive "N/A" as an answer for the information, simply sending the foods name and omitting the brand will be acceptable.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Send Amounts</h3>
      <p>Piabetes will automatically find the correct carb and dietary fiber count for an amount you text. The amount should come before the food in the text, and should include units, such as "1 cup milk", or "12 grams bread". Please notice that none of the requests say "1 cup <i>of</i> milk". The <i>of</i> is omitted to minimize errors, and raise the chance that Piabetes will correctly interpret the request.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Don't Worry About Capitalization</h3>
      <p>Any requests sent to Piabetes are automatically converted to lowercase, so it sees no difference between "French Fries" and "french fries".</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
<p>Following thise tips will make using Piabetes even easier, and keep the errors to a minimum.</p>
