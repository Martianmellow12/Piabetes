<h1>Piabetes</h1>
<h3>Information Retrieval Software For Diabetics</h3>
<p>
This project was designed for my brother, who has type 1 diabetes, but I've released the source here so that anybody can use it. The project was created because whenever we were out and about, we would look up carb information on our phones. Quite often, we would have bad service, and loading 1 page could take 10 minutes. This, combined with having to search repeatedly, made for a long, cold meal. We could usually text, however. This is how Piabetes works. A Raspberry Pi, running at the users home, will be running Piabetes. The user texts a TextMagic number, and Piabetes receives this. It searches Wolfram Alpha for information, and texts it's findings back to the user. This allows the user to get information from the internet, without actually having to connect via 3G or other cellular data service. The whole thing is written in python, making it versatile for non-raspi users. Simply leave it running on a desktop computer that's connected to the internet, and it'll work the same.
